Program Description:
    This software system is a multi computer processing system that utilize the
cores of multiple computers on a network to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
The system is designed to maximize the efficiency of the user and run multiple
tasks quickly that otherwise would be run one at a time. It  utilizes javas built
in multi threading to have each computer used on a separate thread. The software
can be run from one computer that has access to the ENCS network.


IDE used:
    The IDE used to develop this project was IntelliJ IDEA 15 CE. If you would like
to modify any code it is recommend that you use this IDE as well.


Build environment:
    java version "1.8.0_51"


Environment Setup Part 1:
    First make sure your machine has maven if it does continue to the next
part.  If not, install brew through the terminal with the following command
" $ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" "
Once brew has been installed run the following command to get maven.
" $brew install maven " Now move JobScheduler.jar into the desired directory.


Environment Setup Part 2:
    If you would like to view the source code, cd into JobScheduler and then
" $mvn clean install ". This will make sure that you have all the correct dependencies to
run the program. The environment should be ready to run at this point.

Running the Application:
    First make sure that you are on the ENCS network. If you are not on the ENCS network
the program will not work.

    If you would only like to run the program without looking at any of the source
code you can run the executable JobScheduler.jar. If you want to run the program from
the terminal the following command will work. " $java -jar JobScheduler.jar ". After
this command is executed a java application will begin to start up. If you run the
program through the terminal there will be out put for you to see. You can also just
double click the JobScheduler.jar as well so start the java application. If you choose
to do this you will not be able to see what would normally be printing out to the
terminal console. If you open the source in an IntelliJ IDE run the program from
'gui/Configure.java'.


Executable files to run setup:
    The directory which is holding all of your executable files that you want to execute
need to be placed in your home directory on the ENCS network. The directory also needs
to be relabeled as " Jobs " for the program to be able to find it.


Output of Application:
    Which ever way you decide to run the program application, you will be prompted at first
on whether or not you would like to create a configuration file. If it is your first time
running the program you will need to create a configuration file. The configuration file
will store your ENCS username, password, and all of the hosts that you chose to use. This
information will be used to SSH into the network.

    The configuration file will be created in the project directory. A Log.txt file will
also be created in the same directory. The Log.txt file is where you can go to find the
output of the scripts that were executed on the ENCS machines.
